# All the runs!

Yeah sweet you copied the code but where can you run this?

### Docker

A quick way to play with command line scripts is to bring up a Ubuntu docker container. The scripts will then need `--allow-run-as-root` when executing. (for reasons?)

```
docker run -ti --name ubuntu-c ubuntu
docker start -i ubuntu-c
```

Then install git & python, clone this repository and run the commands shown above per example.

Example:

```
time mpiexec --allow-run-as-root python primenumbers27.py
```
