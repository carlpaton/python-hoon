# Python: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Popular packages used for `Python` **Machine Learning**

### NumPy 

`NumPy` provides the foundation data structures and operations for `SciPy`. These are arrays (`ndarrays`) that are efficient to define and manipulate.

### Matplotlib

`Matplotlib` can be used for creating plots and charts. The library is generally used as follows:

1. Call a plotting function with some data (e.g. plot()).
2. Call many functions to setup the properties of the plot (e.g. labels and colors).
3. Make the plot visible (e.g. show()).

### Pandas

`Pandas` provides data structures and functionality to quickly manipulate and analyze data. The key to understanding Pandas for machine learning is understanding the Series and DataFrame data structures.
