### Bubble Sort

Given a list of numbers, `bubblesort27.py` iterates though them one at a time and compare the current `item` with its neighbor to see if it is greater/less than depending on the sort being asc/desc. Based on this you swap them. As a result the number bubble their way up. Not the most efficient way but it works.

```
python bubblesort27.py
```
